/**
 * Server action for accepting terms and conditions.
 * Updates user record with acceptance timestamp and version.
 * Sets persistent httpOnly cookie for terms acceptance tracking.
 * 
 * COOKIE SECURITY:
 * The terms_version cookie is set with httpOnly: true, which means:
 * - Cannot be accessed via JavaScript (document.cookie)
 * - Only readable by server-side code (middleware, API routes, server actions)
 * - Protected from XSS attacks
 * - Automatically included in requests to same origin
 * 
 * COOKIE BEHAVIOR:
 * - Development (NODE_ENV !== "production"): secure flag is false (allows HTTP)
 * - Production: secure flag is true (requires HTTPS)
 * - sameSite: "lax" (included in top-level navigation, not cross-site requests)
 * - maxAge: 1 year (persistent across browser sessions)
 * - path: "/" (available to all routes)
 * 
 * SERVER-SIDE ACCESS:
 * The cookie is read in src/proxy.ts middleware using request.cookies.get("terms_version")
 * to enforce terms acceptance before accessing protected routes. This is secure because:
 * - Middleware runs on server-side (Node.js or Edge runtime)
 * - Cookie is automatically included in requests via Set-Cookie/Cookie headers
 * 
 * RACE CONDITION MITIGATION:
 * To prevent race conditions where middleware might execute before the cookie is set:
 * 1. Cookie is set synchronously in this server action
 * 2. Multiple paths are revalidated to ensure Next.js updates its cache
 * 3. Client should wait for this action to complete before redirecting
 * 4. Middleware uses a redirect_count cookie (with 5-minute TTL) to handle edge cases
 * 
 * The combination of revalidation + redirect waiting + cookie-based loop detection
 * ensures reliable terms acceptance even under high latency conditions.
 * 
 * @param version - The terms version being accepted (must match current TERMS_VERSION)
 * @throws {Error} If database update fails
