**1. Information We Collect**
To provide the GhostClass service, we collect and process specific categories of data:

* **Identity & Contact Information:** When you create an account, we collect your **legal name, email address, phone number, birth date, and gender from EzyGo**. This data is used for account management, security verification, and essential service communications.
* **Authentication Credentials:** We require your EzyGo authentication token to fetch data on your behalf. **We strictly DO NOT store your raw password.** We only store the encrypted session token.
* **Academic Data:** We cache your attendance records, course names, and schedule data to improve load times and provide analytics.
* **Communication Data:** If you contact us via our support forms, we collect your name, email, and message content to address your inquiry, regardless of whether you have a registered account.

We employ industry-standard security measures to protect your data:
* **AES-256 Encryption:** All sensitive tokens are encrypted using **AES-256** before being written to our database.
