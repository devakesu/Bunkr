  # 
  # Two scenarios:
  # 1. Branch name format x.x.x (e.g., "1.5.6"):
  #    - Version files are already updated in the merged PR
  #    - Creates tag directly (no PR needed)
  # 
  # 2. Branch name NOT in x.x.x format (e.g., "copilot/*", "feature/*"):
  #    - Version needs to be bumped automatically
  #    - Creates PR with version bump → Merges immediately → Creates tag
  #    - Note: test.yml may still run tests on version-bump PRs via pull_request_target,
  #      but this pipeline does not wait for those tests (only version numbers change)
  #    - Previous PR's tests are sufficient for validation
  # 
  # For tags created by this workflow, .github/workflows/release.yml is invoked via an
  # explicit workflow_dispatch step (workflow-created tags do not auto-trigger other workflows),
  # which builds, signs, and deploys the Docker image with the correct version.

            Automated version bump to v${{ steps.check.outputs.version }}
            
            This PR was automatically created by the CI/CD pipeline.
            
            **Changes:**
            - Updated package.json and package-lock.json
            - Updated .example.env (NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION)
            - Updated public/api-docs/openapi.yaml
            
            **Note:** This PR is intended to be merged automatically by the CI/CD pipeline.
            It only updates version numbers (not code logic), so the previous PR's tests are sufficient.
