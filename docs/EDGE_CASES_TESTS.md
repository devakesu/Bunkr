# Edge Case Analysis & Test Scenarios for EzyGo Rate Limiting

This file documents edge cases and provides test scenarios to verify the rate limiting implementation works correctly.

## Edge Case 1: User Refreshes Dashboard Rapidly

**Scenario:** User hits F5 multiple times in quick succession

**Expected Behavior:**
- First request: Triggers API calls
- Subsequent requests (within 60s): Share in-flight promises and use cached responses
- Result: Only 3 API calls total, not 9 (3 per refresh)

**Implementation:**
- LRU cache with 60s TTL deduplicates in-flight requests and caches resolved responses
- Cache key structure: `${method}:${hashedToken}:${normalizedEndpoint}:${hashedBody}`
  - Token and body are SHA-256 hashed for security
  - Endpoint is normalized (leading slashes removed)
  - Body uses sentinel value `__SENTINEL_NO_BODY_VALUE__` when undefined
- Same user = same cache key = shared request/cached response

## Edge Case 2: 100 Users Hit Dashboard Simultaneously

**Scenario:** Traffic spike - 100 concurrent users

**Expected Behavior:**
- Max 3 concurrent API calls at any time
- Queue forms automatically
- All users eventually get data
- No 429 (Rate Limit) errors from EzyGo

**Timeline:**
- Users 1-3: Immediate
- Users 4-100: Queued (FIFO)
- Last user: ~60-70s wait (worst case)

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Request deduplication reduces actual API calls
- Circuit breaker prevents retry storms
- Conservative MAX_CONCURRENT = 3

## Edge Case 3: EzyGo API Goes Down Mid-Request

**Scenario:** API fails during active requests

**Expected Behavior:**
- First 2 failures: Circuit remains CLOSED
- 3rd failure: Circuit OPENS (threshold = 3, opens when failures >= threshold)
- Subsequent requests: Fail fast (503 error)
- After 60s: Circuit transitions to HALF_OPEN
- 2 test requests: If successful, circuit CLOSES

**User Experience:**
- First users: See error after timeout
- Queued users: Fail fast (don't wait for timeout)
- Clear error message: "Service temporarily unavailable"

## Edge Case 4: Different Users, Same Data Request

**Scenario:** Multiple users need same public data

**Cache Key Structure:** `${method}:${hashedToken}:${normalizedEndpoint}:${hashedBody}`
- Token and body are SHA-256 hashed
- Endpoint is normalized (leading slashes removed)
- Body uses sentinel value `__SENTINEL_NO_BODY_VALUE__` when undefined

Different users = Different token hashes = Different cache keys
Result: NO deduplication across users

**Reasoning:**
- User data is personalized
- Can't share responses across users (security)
- Rate limiting still applies (max 3 concurrent)

## Edge Case 5: Login During Circuit Open

**Scenario:** User tries to login while circuit is OPEN

**Flow:**
1. User submits login
2. Client → /api/backend/login → Proxy
3. Proxy wraps in circuit breaker
4. Circuit is OPEN → Fails fast
5. User sees: "Service temporarily unavailable"

**Expected Behavior:**
- Login fails gracefully
- Clear error message
- No infinite loading spinner
- User can retry after 60s

## Edge Case 6: Dashboard SSR vs Client Fetch Race

**Scenario:** SSR provides initialData, but React Query also fetches

**Flow:**
1. Server fetches data → initialData
2. Client hydrates with initialData
3. React Query sees initialData → Uses it
4. After staleTime (30s) → Background refetch

**Expected Behavior:**
- No duplicate requests on page load
- initialData prevents immediate client fetch
- Background refetch happens after 30s
- Uses rate limiter for background fetches

## Edge Case 7: Token Expires Mid-Request

**Scenario:** Token expires while request is in-flight

**Expected Behavior:**
- EzyGo returns 401 Unauthorized
- Circuit breaker treats 401 (and most 4xx) as NonBreakerError
- 401 responses do NOT increment the circuit breaker failure count or OPEN the circuit
- User gets logged out or re-authenticated via existing auth logic (independent of the circuit breaker)

**Risk:**
- Auth failures (401) are handled outside the circuit breaker and won't by themselves OPEN the circuit
- Breaker state changes remain reserved for true API reliability issues (e.g. 5xx/429)

**Mitigation:**
- Token refresh or re-authentication mechanisms handle expired tokens
- Auth errors (401/other 4xx) are handled separately from breaker-worthy API errors (5xx/429), and only 5xx/429 increment breaker failure counts

## Edge Case 8: Slow Network + Timeout

**Scenario:** Request takes > 15s (timeout)

**Expected Behavior:**
- AbortController triggers at 15s
- Request aborted
- Slot released
- Queue processes next request
- Circuit breaker counts as failure

After 3 timeouts → Circuit OPENS

## Edge Case 9: Memory Leak from Cache

**Scenario:** Cache grows too large

**Prevention:**
- LRU cache max = 500 entries
- Each entry = promise reference (small)
- TTL = 60s (auto cleanup)
- updateAgeOnGet = false (strict expiry)

**Memory Usage:**
- ~500 entries × ~100 bytes = ~50KB
- Negligible memory footprint

## Edge Case 10: Multiple Server Instances

**Scenario:** App deployed with multiple servers

**Current Implementation:**
- Rate limiter is per-instance (in-memory)
- Cache is per-instance (in-memory)
- Each server = 3 concurrent requests

**With 5 servers:**
- Total concurrent = 5 × 3 = 15 requests

**Risk:**
- More aggressive than single-IP (current setup)
- May need to reduce MAX_CONCURRENT

**Solution:**
- For multi-instance: Reduce to MAX_CONCURRENT = 2
- Or implement Redis-based rate limiting

## Monitoring Checklist

### Metrics to Track

**1. Rate Limiter:**
- activeRequests (should stay ≤ 3)
- queueLength (alert if > 15 sustained)
- cacheSize (should fluctuate 0-50)

**2. Circuit Breaker:**
- state (CLOSED normal, alert if OPEN)
- failures (track patterns)
- openings per hour (should be 0)

**3. API Performance:**
- Request duration (p50, p95, p99)
- Error rate
- Timeout rate

**4. User Experience:**
- Dashboard load time
- Login success rate
- Error messages displayed
